This is a website which will be used as a portfolio for me to showcase my work done as a video editor and community manager. 

It will also showcase my ability to create a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is the first website I will create without following along to the direction of TheOdinProject, and am using only my knowledge, skills, and creativity to create it.
